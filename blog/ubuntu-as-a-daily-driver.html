    <div class="post-title">Ubuntu As A Daily Driver?</div>
    <div class="post-text">I’ve recently acquired a 3-year-old Toshiba Satellite with a core I3 (running @ 2.4mHz) with 8GB or RAM and installed ubuntu on it. Coming from my windows machine I found ubuntu a refreshing and pleasantly fast OS. Once I got a few GNOME themes, installed VScode and updated python I was on my way to start using it either as a second screen (for documentation, etc) or as a code interpreter. Due to an unfortunate set of events (which can be described by two words “Windows Update” I was forced to use it as a main PC which not at all to my surprise (based on my experience earlier) wasn’t a pain at all. The only downside I that I had to get a custom build of GitHub Desktop for Linux but that only took up a few moments. Its amazing how snappy and responsive this 3-year-old machine feels, aided by that 8GB of RAM. Unsurprisingly it was faster than my main windows machine, the terminal was actually so fast (comparing to the speed that I was accustomed to on my windows machine) that I couldn’t believe my eyes. When windows finished updating (It might of been a few months, or years) I left the ubuntu machine and returned back to cumbersome old windows.</div>
